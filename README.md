In this assignment we run some implementations of Dyna and Dyna-Q+ on a dynamic GridWorld environment whose starting states, goal states,
and obstacles can be experimented with. The experiments run are loosely based off of those in Sutton's book, where 1) we show the benefit
of learning from simulated experience; and 2) we show that Dyna-Q+ can recover from a dynamically changing environment much quicker than
Dyna-Q+. 

Unfortunately, for the sake of time I was unable to show more concepts (like prioritised sweeping).
